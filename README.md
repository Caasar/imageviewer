# imageviewer

A very simple image viewer written in python using PySide or PyQt4. It is optimized for reading zipped DRM free comics and is inspired by CDisplay which is no longer in active development. By using the rarfile module it also supports rar archives.

Simply drag 'n drop a zip/rar file, a folder or a webpage containing images into the viewer.
